Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. This is a behavior required in complex problem domains like machine translation, speech recognition, and more. LSTMs are a complex area of deep learning.

The objectives of this project are to:
• Design a model that uses Machine Learning techniques to help in navigating the fast-changing stock market.
• Help investors to make right buy and sell decisions.
• How ML techniques and algorithms can help in stock price predictions and be helpful for investors.
• Validation of the model to assess and predict accurately based on the real time Stock data.
